# Image Classification with Convolutional Neural Networks

This project aims to classify skin images into different classes of monkeypox diseases using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The CNN is a popular deep learning architecture that is particularly effective for image recognition and classification tasks.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the Monkeypox Skin Image Dataset, which can be downloaded from Kaggle at the following link: [Monkeypox Skin Image Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/dipuiucse/monkeypoxskinimagedataset).

To use the dataset, follow these steps:

1. Download the dataset from the provided Kaggle link.
2. Extract the dataset to a local directory on your machine.

The dataset contains images of skin lesions caused by monkeypox, divided into different classes based on the severity and type of the disease.

## Prerequisites

Before running this project, ensure that you have the following dependencies installed:

- Python (version 3.6 or higher)
- TensorFlow (version 2.0 or higher)
- Keras (version 2.4 or higher)
- NumPy (version 1.16 or higher)
- Matplotlib (version 3.0 or higher)

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository to your local machine or download the project files.
2. Set up the Python environment with the required dependencies mentioned in the "Prerequisites" section.
3. Place the extracted dataset in the project directory.

## Training the Model

To train the CNN model on the Monkeypox Skin Image Dataset, follow these steps:

1. Run the `train.py` script:
   ```
   python train.py --dataset_path <path_to_dataset> --output_path <output_directory>
   ```
   Replace `<path_to_dataset>` with the path to the extracted dataset directory and `<output_directory>` with the desired directory where the trained model and training logs will be saved.

2. The training process will begin, and you will see progress updates and metrics being printed to the console. The model will be trained on the training set and validated on the test set.

3. After training, the script will save the trained model in the specified output directory. It will also generate training logs and evaluation metrics, including accuracy and loss curves.

## Making Predictions

Once you have trained the model, you can use it to make predictions on new skin images. To do this, follow these steps:

1. Prepare the skin images you want to classify and place them in a separate directory, e.g., `new_images/`.

2. Run the `predict.py` script:
   ```
   python predict.py --model_path <path_to_model> --image_dir <path_to_images>
   ```
   Replace `<path_to_model>` with the path to the trained model file (e.g., `output/model.h5`) and `<path_to_images>` with the path to the directory containing the skin images you want to classify (e.g., `new_images/`).

3. The script will load the trained model, process the images, and output the predicted class for each image.

## Customization

Feel free to modify and customize the code to suit your specific needs. You can experiment with different hyperparameters, network architectures, and preprocessing techniques to improve the model's performance. Refer to the TensorFlow and Keras documentation for more information on how to work with these libraries.

## Conclusion

This readme file provides a brief overview of the image classification project using Convolutional Neural Networks. Follow the instructions provided to set up the project, train the model on the Monkeypox Skin Image Dataset, and make predictions on new skin images. With some experimentation and fine-tuning, you can achieve accurate classification results for monkeypox disease diagnosis. Good luck!
